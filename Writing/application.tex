\section{Leakage on Application}

A specific device running a specific application could be fingerprinted through observing its PING response time.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Offline: Fingerprint the potential products available on the public market.
	\item Online: Find a fingerprint in the "database" that matches the target.
\end{itemize}

Knowing the application provides hint to the potential plaintext, which could lead to more severe breach.
